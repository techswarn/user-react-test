<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

We wanted a tool internally that would help us rapidly scale our SEO efforts, but ultimately, give us the ability to migrate offf our current toolchain for SEO. Like many agencies, our team spent thousands on SEO-realted software each year. Since we're not a multi-million dollar agency, it always hurts to pay those bills.

In light of that, we are building this software initially for our own team. We have already seen the power of competing with well-known tools that currently exist. One thing we aim to achieve is more honesty and more transparency. This is why we are building some modules has open-source NPM packages. So, give all developers the ability to see exactly what we're doing and contribute if they desire.
